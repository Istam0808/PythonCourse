# Find the maximum possible path sum between two leaf nodes when given a binary tree with each node element containing a number. The leaf node is a node connected to exactly one different node.
# Given a binary tree T, find its height.
# Given a binary search tree, BT, write a code to count the leaves.  
# Given a binary tree T, write a code in Python to print the right view of the tree. 
# For a given binary tree T, write a code in Python to print the height of the binary tree.
# For a given AVL tree, insert a value into the tree from given N values to be inserted.
