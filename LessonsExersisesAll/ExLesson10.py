# 5. Write a Python program that accepts a word 
# from the user and reverses it.

# def reverse_text(string):
#     return string[::-1]
# print(reverse_text(input('enter text to reverse: ')))



# 6. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd
# numbers in a series of numbers
# Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
# Expected Output :
# Number of even numbers : 5
# Number of odd numbers : 4

# def even_and_odds(numbers):
#     even = 0
#     odd = 0
#     for num in numbers:
#         if num % 2 == 0:
#             even += 1
#         else:
#             odd += 1
#     return even, odd
# numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
# even_count, odd_count = even_and_odds(numbers)
# print("even nums count:", even_count)
# print("odd nums count:", odd_count)
